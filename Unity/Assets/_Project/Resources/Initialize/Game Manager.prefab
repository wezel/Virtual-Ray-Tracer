      description: There's also a transparent wall behind the lens. Because the wall
        is transparent, you would expect that light rays can pass through it. However,
        they don't. This is a limitation of the way the ray tracer generates light
        rays.

      description: The ray tracer determines light rays by tracing a straight line
        from the object to the light source. The transparent wall bends light, so
        it won't work. Therefore, the lights rays are blocked and replaced by shadow
        rays. These shadow rays only take the ambient components into consideration.

      description: Angle attenuation occurs when the light is not directly looking
        at a point, but at an angle. Just like a flashlight, the point it shines
        at is the brightest. The light needs to have a direction, so it does not
        apply to point lights. You can change how strong a spot (or area) light is
        attenuated per light with the "Angle Attenuation" slider. Try it!
